# Fully Completed Microservices Project

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of fully completed microservices built with Spring Boot version 3.2.5 and Java 17. The project utilizes Spring Cloud version 2023.0.1 for implementing various distributed system patterns and features.

## Microservices Description

1. **Config Server**
   - Provides centralized configuration for all microservices.
   - Uses Spring Cloud Config Server.

2. **Customer Service**
   - Manages customer data and operations.
   - Integrated with Eureka Discovery.

3. **Discovery Service**
   - Service registry using Netflix Eureka.
   - Enables service discovery for other microservices.

4. **Gateway Service**
   - API Gateway for routing requests to appropriate microservices.
   - Uses Spring Cloud Gateway.
   - Includes distributed tracing and circuit breaker.

5. **Notification Service**
   - Handles notifications and alerts.
   - Uses Kafka for messaging.

6. **Order Service**
   - Manages orders and their statuses.
   - Integrated with Eureka Discovery.

7. **Payment Service**
   - Processes payments.
   - Uses Eureka Discovery and Zipkin for tracing.

8. **Product Service**
   - Manages product information.
   - Integrated with Eureka Discovery.

## Features

- **Service Discovery**: All microservices register with the Eureka server for easy discovery.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Configurations are managed centrally using the Spring Cloud Config Server.
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway is used for routing and handling cross-cutting concerns like security, monitoring, and resilience.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Zipkin is used for tracing requests across microservices.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Circuit breaking capabilities provided by Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker.
- **Messaging**: Kafka is used for asynchronous communication between microservices.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven or Gradle
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Running the Microservices

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PramithaMJ/fully-completed-microservices.git
   cd fully-completed-microservices
   ```

2. **Start Config Server**
   ```sh
   cd config-server
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Start Discovery Service**
   ```sh
   cd discovery
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Start Other Microservices**
   Start the remaining microservices in any order. Ensure they are configured to register with the Discovery Service.

   ```sh
   cd <microservice-name>
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Configuration

Each microservice has its configuration properties defined in the `application.yml` or `application.properties` file. The Config Server properties should be specified in a central configuration repository.

## Deployment

To deploy the microservices using Docker, use the Dockerfile available in each microservice directory. You can build and run the Docker images as follows:

```sh
cd <microservice-name>
docker build -t <microservice-name>:latest .
docker run -d -p <port>:<container-port> <microservice-name>:latest
```
